# firebase-get-IdToken

This is example index.html file to get id token from our firebae account. 
I have use this index.html to retrive idToken and test firbase libraries. Hope this will helpfull!. 

#### note

you need provide correct paramter from firebase console .
read firbase docs how to get https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup correct prams. 

```
  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  // For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
  var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "",
    authDomain: "",
    databaseURL: "",
    projectId: "",
    storageBucket: "",
    messagingSenderId: "",
    appId: "",
    measurementId: ""
  };
```

Thanks !!
